Smart Tremor Analysis System for Parkinson’s Screening
Developed a wearable tremor monitoring system using IMU sensors and ESP32 for early screening of Parkinsonian tremors.
Applied signal processing techniques including band-pass filtering and FFT to extract tremor frequency and amplitude features.
Built machine learning models to classify tremor patterns into normal and Parkinsonian-like with 90%+ accuracy.
Designed a real-time visualization dashboard for tremor analysis and risk indication.

Parkinson’s disease causes resting tremors (4–6 Hz) that are often subtle in early stages and missed during routine checkups. Clinical diagnosis is subjective and depends heavily on observation.
A wearable tremor analysis system that:
Measures hand tremors using inertial sensors
Analyzes tremor frequency & amplitude
Uses signal processing + ML
Classifies tremor as Normal / Parkinsonian-like
Displays results on a dashboard
